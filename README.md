# Goal of the project

Before starting the whole development process, I needed to plan out the structure of my Linktree clone. I identified the different components that I would need to build, such as the header, the bio section, and the link section. To help me visualize the different components, I sketched out a basic wireframe of my clone. This allowed me to have a clear roadmap of what needed to be developed and how everything would fit together. Planning was a crucial step in the development process as it ensured that I built the right product in the most efficient way possible.
